# weather_watcher
Simple program that writes weather values to files. 

Copy the sample config to `~/.config/weather_watcher/config.json`

Fill in the information. You need an API key from Wunderground

Add it to crontab

It should start writing weather information to ~/.weather_watcher

MAINLY FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE
